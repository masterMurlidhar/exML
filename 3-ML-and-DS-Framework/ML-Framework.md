# Machine Learning and Data Science Framework ;

    >_ Different type of problems have different types of solution frameworks...


# 1. Problem Definition ;
        >_ What kind of problem it is ?

        1_ Supervised Learning

        2_ Unsupervised Learning

        3_ Transfer Learning

        4_ Reinforcement Learning


# 2. Data ;
        >_ What kind of data does it have ?

        1_  Structured Data

        2_  Unstructured Data

                A_  Static Data
                        >_  Comma Separated Values ( .CSV Files)

                B_  Streaming Data
                        >_ When static data is ready for implementation, It has to be updated regularly & it becomes Streaming data...


# 3. Evaluation ;
        >_  What defies success, 95% or 99% or 90% of accuracy...

    
# 4. Features ;
        >_  What do we already know about data ?

        >_  Is it numerical or catagorical feature ?


# 5. Modeling ;
        >_ Three Parts of modeling ;
                1. Choosing & Training a Model,  (Training Data)
                2. Tuning a Model,               (Validation Data)
                3. Model Comparison,             (Test Data)

        # Part-I ;
                >_  Model the data into 3 sets indivisually (Training Data: 70, Validation Data: 15, Test Data: 15), Don't feed the test data directly because, It's a learning process...

        # Part-II, Choosing a Model ;
                >_  

        # Part-III ;
                >_
